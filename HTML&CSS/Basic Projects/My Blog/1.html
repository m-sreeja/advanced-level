        <p>Imagination and the Belief are the two gateways of reality.A belief is an idea that we accept to be true.It can be conscious or subconscious.Beliefs are powerful.Your brain conveys your thoughts and beliefs to your brain.An imagined experience and a real experience have almost the same effect on your mind.</p>

        <div class="head"><p>Goals change with Time.</p></div>
        <p><i>"A goal with out a plan is just a wish!"</i><br>Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another.It is very important to understand that your goals change.This is because you want something today but tomorrow you may not want it or you may want something else.Just change your goals because "Journey is the reward "-it means that the hope,the struggle and the hardwork towards a goal/success is part of the reward. Achieving goal in itself is not the whole world.</p>
